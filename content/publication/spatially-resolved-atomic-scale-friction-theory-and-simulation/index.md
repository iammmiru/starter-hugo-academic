abstract: We analyze the friction force exerted on a small probe particle
  sliding over an atomic-scale surface by means of a Green-Kubo relation and
  classical molecular dynamics simulations. We find that, on the atomic scale,
  the friction tensor can drastically vary as a function of position and sliding
  direction. The Green-Kubo relation yields this positional and directional
  dependence from equilibrium simulations of the time-dependent covariance of
  force acting on the probe. We find, unexpectedly, that the positional and
  directional dependence of energy dissipation is related to the (much simpler)
  static force covariance, especially in the limit where the probe only mildly
  perturbs the surface particles. In contrast, the (free-)energy landscape
  experienced by the probe is in general not a good indicator of local
  dissipation. We also discuss optimization strategies making use of the locally
  and directionally resolved friction tensor. This enables us to find optimal
  sliding paths and velocity protocols, e.g., minimizing energy dissipation,
  between two points on the surface in a given time.
