Can seemingly random noise in a data set have meaningful information?
You would be surprised how much insights we can extract out of noisy and massive data.

I develop models to understand stochastic systems where constituting elements move randomly with some global and/or local trends. I predict such systems' behaviors based on their statistical properties.

And, it is my passion to apply my knowlegde to real-world problems so that we can creat values that are otherwise left unseen.
