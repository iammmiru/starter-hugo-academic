I studied dynamics of living organisms, such as bacteria. I developed an algorithm to simulate motion of bacteria (E. coli), and investigated their collective behaviors. I published 2 papers in peer-reviewed journals.
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Collision Detection
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Data Visualization
