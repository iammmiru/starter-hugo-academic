abstract: "We theoretically study the frictional damping of a small probe object
  on a coated planar surface, analyzing the resulting phonon modes via a theory
  of viscoelasticity. Three different types of excitations are found to
  contribute to friction in distinct ways: traveling (3D) spherical waves,
  traveling (2D) surface waves, and evanescent waves. While traveling waves
  transport energy away from the probe, determined by long range elastic
  properties (wavelength), evanescent waves transform energy into heat in a
  near-field range, characterized by the size of the probe. Thus, fundamentally
  different behaviors are predicted, depending on coating thickness and material
  properties."
