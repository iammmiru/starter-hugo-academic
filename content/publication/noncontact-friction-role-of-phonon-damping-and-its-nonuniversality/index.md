abstract: "While obtaining theoretical predictions for dissipation during
  sliding motion is a difficult task, one regime that allows for analytical
  results is the so-called noncontact regime, where a probe is weakly
  interacting with the surface over which it moves. Studying this regime for a
  model crystal, we extend previously obtained analytical results and confirm
  them quantitatively via particle based computer simulations. Accessing the
  subtle regime of weak coupling in simulations is possible via use of
  Green-Kubo relations. The analysis allows us to extract and compare the two
  paradigmatic mechanisms that have been found to lead to dissipation: phonon
  radiation, prevailing even in a purely elastic solid, and phonon damping,
  e.g., caused by viscous motion of crystal atoms. While phonon radiation is
  dominant at large probe-surface distances, phonon damping dominates at small
  distances. Phonon radiation is furthermore a pairwise additive phenomenon so
  that the dissipation due to interaction with different parts (areas) of the
  surface adds up. This additive scaling results from a general one-to-one
  mapping between the mean probe-surface force and the friction due to phonon
  radiation, irrespective of the nature of the underlying pairwise interaction.
  In contrast, phonon damping is strongly nonadditive, and no such general
  relation exists. We show that for certain cases, the dissipation can even
  decrease with increasing surface area the probe interacts with. The above
  properties, which are rooted in the spatial correlations of surface
  fluctuations, are expected to have important consequences when interpreting
  experimental measurements, as well as scaling with system size."
