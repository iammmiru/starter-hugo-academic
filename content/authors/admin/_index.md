Can seemingly random noise in data have any meaningful information?
You would be surprised to know how many insights we can extract out of random fluctuations.

I develop models to understand stochastic systems where constituting elements move randomly with some global and/or local trends. I predict such systems' behaviors based on their statistical properties.

Currently completing my PhD, I'm excited about applying my knowledge to real-world problems so that we can create new values.
