abstract: We study the transport of bacteria in a porous media modeled by a
  square channel containing one cylindrical obstacle via molecular dynamics
  simulations coupled to a lattice Boltzmann fluid. Our bacteria model is a
  rod-shaped rigid body which is propelled by a force-free mechanism. To account
  for the behavior of living bacteria, the model also incorporates a
  run-and-tumble process. The model bacteria are capable of hydrodynamically
  interacting with both of the channel walls and the obstacle. This enables the
  bacteria to get reoriented when experiencing a shear-flow. We demonstrate that
  this model is capable of reproducing the bacterial accumulation on the rear
  side of an obstacle, as has recently been experimentally observed by [G. L.
  Mi√±o, et al., Adv. Microbiol., 2018, 8, 451] using E. coli bacteria. By
  systematically varying the external flow strength and the motility of the
  bacteria, we resolve the interplay between the local flow strength and the
  swimming characteristics that lead to the accumulation. Moreover, by changing
  the geometry of the channel, we also reveal the important role of the
  interactions between the bacteria and the confining walls for the accumulation
  process.
