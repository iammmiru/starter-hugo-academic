I develop theories to understand complex systems, in which the constituting components move randomly with some global or/and local trends. I published 2 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and two more papers are either submitted or ready to be submitted. You can find the articles {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14219" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03025" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01151" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
