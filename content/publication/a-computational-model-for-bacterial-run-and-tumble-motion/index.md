abstract: In this article we present a computational model for the simulation of
  self-propelled anisotropic bacteria. To this end we use a self-propelled
  particle model and augment it with a statistical algorithm for the
  run-and-tumble motion. We derive an equation for the distribution of
  reorientations of the bacteria that we use to analyze the statistics of the
  random walk and that allows us to tune the behavior of our model to the
  characteristics of an E. coli bacterium. We validate our implementation in
  terms of a single swimmer and demonstrate that our model is capable of
  reproducing E. coliâ€™s run-and-tumble motion with excellent accuracy.
