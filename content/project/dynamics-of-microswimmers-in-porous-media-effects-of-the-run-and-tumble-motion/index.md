I studied dynamics of living organisms, such as bacteria. I developed an algorithm to simulate motion of bacteria (E. coli), and investigated their collective behaviors. This involved implementing a Monte-Carlo algorithm, a collision detection, and fluid dynamics simulations. I published 2 papers in peer-reviewed journals.
