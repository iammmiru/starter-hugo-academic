I wrote python codes evaluating a company's intrinsic value, using a discounted free cash flow model. My calculators estimate the future cash flow using either supervised deep learning or publicly available analysts' predictions. The resulting intrinsic value of a company tells us whether its current stock price is undervalued or overvalued. You can find the codes {{< staticref "https://github.com/iammmiru/DFC_calculator" "newtab" >}}on my github{{< /staticref >}}.
