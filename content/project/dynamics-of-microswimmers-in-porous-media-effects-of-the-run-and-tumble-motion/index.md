I studied dynamics of living organisms, such as bacteria. I developed an algorithm to simulate motion of bacteria (E. coli), and investigated their collective behaviors. I published 2 papers in peer-reviewed journals: {{< staticref "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03345" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/sm/d0sm01595d" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
